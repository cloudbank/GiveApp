Androidx, ICS(15) to Android10, latest best practices @ google

`MVVM` pattern with `Paging`, `LiveData` and `Room`, and `Repository` pattern are used to page in scraped
data for the UI and also back-fill from the network as the user reaches the end of the list or
LiveData detects a change.  Covid data is as up to date as possible, but may change suddenly.
Swipe to refresh is available on the toolbar to get the very latest.

`Room` uses a `DataSource.Factory` as a positional data source and the Paging Boundary Callback
API to get notified when the Paging library consumes the available local data.  NetworkState implementation
keeps track of network status.

Cached content is always available on the device and the user will still have a good experience even if the network is slow /
unavailable ---> OFFLINE_MODE!
Glide caches images as long as they are initially loaded.
